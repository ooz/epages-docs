The meetup took place in the ePages Jena office. The company provided conference rooms, demo machines, snacks, various drinks and pizza.
Despite the short notice 35 attendees including 8 supporters from ePages followed the call. 
The participants were a diverse group of local and transstate developers (from apiOmat, Blandland, Demandware, Energy 4.0, Favendo, GraphDefined, TRITUM and Xceptance), freelancers and college students.

[//]: # (ePages hosted the first Softwerkskammer Jena meetup last thursday)
[//]: # (the Softwerkskammer is a group of developers caring about software craftsmanship)
[//]: # (the topic of the meetup was Docker (due to recent Docker bday, growth, importance and use in the company))
[//]: # (despite short notice: 35 attendees)


## The Talk - Oliver

After a short introduction about the Softwerkskammer and Docker in general, the talk focussed on basic commands, use cases and best practises. The latter were based on the [official Docker recommendations](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices), tips by [Michael](http://crosbymichael.com/dockerfile-best-practices.html) [Crosby](http://crosbymichael.com/dockerfile-best-practices-take-2.html) as well as our experiences with developing, testing, integrating, deploying and running a large e-Commerce platform.

## Containers, Containers, Con... err Workshops, Workshops, Workshops! - Benjamin

* meetup was intended to be more than a talk: attendees should 

* 3 workshops for 3 years of Docker

  1. beginners: docker bday app and tutorial
  2. advanced: build your own dockerfile/image
  3. special: coresos
  
* wait: a 4th "workshop": Docker in Docker
* for the special session some machines were prepared 

## Beginner Workshop - Oliver

The goal of the beginner workshop was to setup the Docker environment, learn the basic commands, run the workflow and get familiar with Docker Compose.
For this the participants followed the [official Docker birthday tutorial](https://github.com/docker/docker-birthday-3/blob/master/tutorial.md) while the more experienced ePagees Benjamin Nothdurft and Kay Abendroth offered assistance.
As kittens bustled around the screens, the Docker newbies built simple web applications using the Python microframework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) -- all running in a container, of course.


## Advanced Workshop - Benjamin



## Special Workshop - Benjamin


## Summary and Outlook - Benjamin

* after that: functional programming

* Thank you to all attendees and ePages coworkers making this happen
